Recent approaches for this task either apply a fixed policy on a state-of-the art Transformer model, or a learnable monotonic attention on a weaker recurrent neural network-based structure. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism, Monotonic Multihead Attention (MMA), which extends the monotonic attention mechanism to multihead attention. We also introduce two novel and interpretable approaches for latency control that are specifically designed for multiple attention heads. We apply MMA to the simultaneous machine translation task and demonstrate better latency-quality tradeoffs compared to MILk, the previous state-of-the-art approach. We analyze how the latency controls affect the attention span and we study the relationship between the speed of a head and the layer it belongs to. Finally, we motivate the introduction of our model by analyzing the effect of the number of decoder layers and heads on quality and latency.", "prompt": "Now you are given a very long document.

The authors also introduce two novel latency regularization methods to control the model's speed and prevent latency from being dominated by a single or a few heads. The proposed MMA model outperforms existing monotonic attention mechanisms on two standard translation benchmarks, IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese (En-Vi) and WMT15 German-English (De-En). The paper also presents detailed ablation studies and analyses on the effect of the number of decoder layers and decoder heads, attention span, attention behaviors, and the rank of the heads.

Though the idea of monotonic multi-head attention sounds interesting, I still have some questions below:\n\nAbout the method:\n   1. Is that possible that the MMA would have worse latency than MILK since all the attention heads need to agree to write while MILK only has one attention head?\n   2.

These models aim to combine the high translation quality of the Transformer architecture with the low latency of monotonic attention mechanisms. The authors also introduce two novel latency regularization methods to control latency and attention span effectively.\n\nThe paper is well-structured and provides a comprehensive overview of the proposed models, their implementation, and experimental setup. The results demonstrate that the proposed MMA models achieve better quality-latency trade-offs than the previous state-of-the-art model, MILk. The authors also present detailed ablation studies and analyses to support their claims.\n\nHowever, there are a few points that could be further clarified or explored in the paper:\n\n1. The authors could provide more insights into the choice of hyperparameters for the latency regularization methods and their impact on the model's performance.\n\n2. It would be interesting to see how the proposed MMA models perform on other language pairs and datasets, as well as in other sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as speech recognition or summarization.\n\n3. The authors mention that the MMA-H model is better suited for streaming systems with stricter efficiency requirements. It would be helpful to provide a more detailed comparison between the two proposed models in terms of their applicability to different real-world scenarios.\n\nOverall, this paper presents a promising approach to simultaneous machine translation by leveraging the power of the Transformer architecture and monotonic attention mechanisms. The proposed models and regularization methods show potential for further exploration and application in various sequence-to-sequence tasks.", "evaluation": "LLM"}
{"query": "Please generate the Abstract section for this paper.", "gt": "Deep neural networks have achieved outstanding performance in many real-world applications with the expense of huge computational resources. The DenseNet, one of the recently proposed neural network architecture, has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in many visual tasks. However, it has great redundancy due to the dense connections of the internal structure, which leads to high computational costs in training such dense networks. To address this issue, we design a reinforcement learning framework to search for efficient DenseNet architectures with layer-wise pruning (LWP) for different tasks, while retaining the original advantages of DenseNet, such as feature reuse, short paths, etc. In this framework, an agent evaluates the importance of each connection between any two block layers, and prunes the redundant connections. In addition, a novel reward-shaping trick is introduced to make DenseNet reach a better trade-off between accuracy and float point operations (FLOPs). Our experiments show that DenseNet with LWP is more compact and efficient than existing alternatives.", "prompt": "Now you are given a very long document.

Our method employs an LSTM controller to generate inference paths and automatically learns to prune weights and connections while maintaining good accuracy on validation datasets. The training process is divided into three stages: curriculum learning, joint training, and training from scratch. We evaluate our method on three benchmarks: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet 2012, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs while maintaining or slightly degrading prediction performance. This allows the network architecture to adaptively achieve a balance between inference accuracy and computational resources.

This work extends BlockDrop to DenseNet architecture making the controller independent form the input image. The approach is evaluated on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets as well as on ImageNet showing promising results.\n\nIn order to improve the paper, the authors could take into consideration the following points:\n1. Given the similarity of the approach with BlockDrop, I would suggest to discuss it in the introduction section clearly stating the similarities and the differences with the proposed approach. \n2. BlockDrop seems to introduce a general framework of policy network to prune neural networks. However, the authors claim that BlockDrop \"can only be applied to ResNets or its variants\". Could the authors comment on this? \n3. In the abstract, the authors claim: \"Our experiments show that DenseNet with LWP is more compact and efficient than existing alternatives\". It is hard to asses if the statement is correct given the evidence presented in the experimental section. It is not clear if the method is more efficient and compact than others, e. g.  CondenseNet. \n4. In the experimental section, addressing the following questions would make the section stronger: What is more important FLOPs or number of parameters? What is the accuracy drop we should allow to pay for reduction in number of parameters or FLOPs?\n5. For the evaluation, I would suggest to show that the learned policy is better than a random one: e. g. not using the controller to define policy (in line 20 of the algorithm) and using a random random policy instead.\n6. In Table 1, some entries for DenseNet LWP are missing. Is the network converging for this setups? \n7. \\sigma is not explained in section 3.3. What is the intuition behind this hyper parameter?\n\n\nAdditional comments:\n1. It might be interesting to compare the method introduced in the paper to a scenario where the controller is conditioned on an input image and adaptively selects the connections/layers in DenseNet at inference time.\n2. It might be interesting to report the number of connections in Table 1 for all the models.\n\n4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "prompt": "Now you are given a very long document.

The method is based on a solid foundation of reinforcement learning and policy gradient, and the authors provide a thorough background on these topics.\n\nThe experimental results are impressive, showing that the proposed method can achieve significant compression and acceleration of DenseNet while maintaining competitive performance. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the child networks and the filter parameters in every convolution layer, which helps to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the paper could be improved:\n\n1.

{"query": "Please generate the Abstract section for this paper.", "gpt4-x_pred": "In this paper, we present a novel approach for estimating uncertainty in supervised learning problems using neural networks. Our method, called Evidential Uncertainty for Regression, combines the concepts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to learn a higher-order evidential distribution over the network's predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various benchmark regression tasks, showing improved performance in terms of root mean squared error and negative log-likelihood compared to existing methods. Additionally, we apply our method to the complex, high-dimensional task of depth estimation, demonstrating that our method can effectively scale to more challenging problems while providing robust uncertainty estimates. Our framework for evidential representation learning provides a means to achieve precise uncertainty metrics required for robust neural network deployment in safety-critical domains.", "gt": "Deterministic neural networks (NNs) are increasingly being deployed in safety critical domains, where calibrated, robust and efficient measures of uncertainty are crucial. While it is possible to train regression networks to output the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood function, the resulting model remains oblivious to the underlying confidence of its predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters. We observe that our evidential regression method learns well-calibrated measures of uncertainty on various benchmarks, scales to complex computer vision tasks, and is robust to adversarial input perturbations.", "prompt": "Please generate the Abstract section for this paper."}

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty. Prior works in this field (Sensoy et al., 2018; Malinin & Gales, 2018) have focused exclusively on modeling uncertainty in the classification domain with Dirichlet prior distributions. Our work extends this field into the broad range of regression learning tasks (e.g. depth estimation, forecasting, robotic control learning, etc.) and demonstrates generalizability to out-of-distribution test samples and complex learning problems.", "prompt": "Please generate the Related Work section for this paper, and you have to cite these papers:\n1.
