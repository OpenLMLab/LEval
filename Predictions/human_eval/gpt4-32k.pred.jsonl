Our method, called Evidential Uncertainty for Regression, combines the concepts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to learn a higher-order evidential distribution over the network's predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various benchmark regression tasks, showing improved performance in terms of root mean squared error and negative log-likelihood compared to existing methods. Additionally, we apply our method to the complex, high-dimensional task of depth estimation, demonstrating that our method can effectively scale to more challenging problems while providing robust uncertainty estimates. Our framework for evidential representation learning provides a means to achieve precise uncertainty metrics required for robust neural network deployment in safety-critical domains.", "gt": "Deterministic neural networks (NNs) are increasingly being deployed in safety critical domains, where calibrated, robust and efficient measures of uncertainty are crucial. While it is possible to train regression networks to output the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood function, the resulting model remains oblivious to the underlying confidence of its predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters. We observe that our evidential regression method learns well-calibrated measures of uncertainty on various benchmarks, scales to complex computer vision tasks, and is robust to adversarial input perturbations.", "prompt": "Please generate the Abstract section for this paper."}

Mixture density networks (Bishop, 1994) introduced a method for modeling complex, multimodal distributions using neural networks. Blundell et al. (2015) proposed a Bayesian approach to weight uncertainty in neural networks, while Gelman et al. (2008) and Gelman (2006) explored the use of weakly informative default prior distributions for logistic and other regression models. Kingma et al. (2015) and Molchanov et al. (2017) developed techniques for variational dropout and sparsifying deep neural networks, respectively. Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017) proposed a simple and scalable method for predictive uncertainty estimation using deep ensembles. Finally, Sensoy et al. (2018) introduced evidential deep learning to quantify classification uncertainty. Our work extends these ideas by proposing a novel method for estimating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in regression tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach on various benchmark problems and the high-dimensional task of depth estimation.", "gt": "Uncertainty estimation has a long history in neural networks, from modeling probability distribution parameters over outputs (Bishop, 1994) to Bayesian deep learning (Kendall & Gal, 2017). Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty. Prior works in this field (Sensoy et al., 2018; Malinin & Gales, 2018) have focused exclusively on modeling uncertainty in the classification domain with Dirichlet prior distributions. Our work extends this field into the broad range of regression learning tasks (e.g. depth estimation, forecasting, robotic control learning, etc.) and demonstrates generalizability to out-of-distribution test samples and complex learning problems.", "prompt": "Please generate the Related Work section for this paper, and you have to cite these papers:\n1.

{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gpt4-x_pred": "The paper introduces a novel approach for estimating the evidence in support of neural network predictions by directly learning both the inferred aleatoric uncertainty as well as the underlying epistemic uncertainty over its predictions. The authors achieve this by placing higher-order prior distributions over the learned parameters governing the distribution from which the observations are drawn. \n\nThe paper is well-written, and the problem setup is clearly defined. The proposed method is thoroughly explained, and the experiments are conducted on various datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other baseline methods in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty benchmarking.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The paper is well-structured, and the proposed method is clearly explained.\n2. The experiments are conducted on various datasets and tasks, such as regression tasks, depth estimation, and out-of-distribution testing.\n3. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other baseline methods in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty benchmarking.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. It would be beneficial to include more real-world datasets to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n2. The authors could include a comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in uncertainty estimation to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the performance of the proposed method.\n3. Some parts of the paper are quite technical and might be difficult to understand for readers not familiar with the topic. The authors could consider adding more intuitive explanations to make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.\n\nQuestions:\n1. How does the proposed method perform in the presence of noisy data? Would it be possible to incorporate some form of noise robustness in the method?\n2. How does the choice of the prior distribution affect the performance of the proposed method? Would it be possible to use other types of prior distributions in the approach?\n3. What is the computational complexity of the proposed method compared to other baseline methods? Is there any trade-off between the performance gains and the increased complexity?\n\nOverall, the paper presents a novel and interesting approach to estimating uncertainty in neural network predictions. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results are promising. With some improvements and further validation on real-world datasets, the paper could make a significant contribution to the field of uncertainty estimation in deep learning.", "gt": "This paper proposes a novel approach to estimate the confidence of predictions in a regression setting. The approach starts from the standard modelling assuming iid samples from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean and variances and places evidential priors. This opens the door to online applications with fully integrated uncertainty estimates. \n\nPros:\n1.\tNovel approach to regression (a similar work has been published at NeurIPS last year for classification [3]), but the extension of the work to regression is important.\n2.\tThe experimental results show consistent improvement in performance over a wide base of benchmarks, scales to large vision problems and behaves robustly against adversarial examples.\n3.\tThe presentation of the paper is overall nice, and the Figures are very useful to the general comprehension of the article.\nCons:\n1.\tThe theory of evidence, which is not widely known in the ML community, is not clearly introduced. \nI think that the authors should consider adding a section similar to Section 3 of Sensoy et al. [3] should be considered. Currently, the only step explaining the evidential approach that I found was in section 3.1, in a very small paragraph (between \u201cthe mean of [\u2026] to \\lambda + 2\\alpha.\u201d). I believe that the article would greatly benefit from a more thorough introduction of concepts linked to the theory of evidence.\n2.\tThe authors briefly mention that KL is not well defined between some NIG distributions (p.5) and propose a custom evidence regularizer, but there\u2019s very little insight given on how this connects to/departs from the ELBO approach. \n\nOther comments/questions:\n1.\t(p.1)  I\u2019m not sure to fully understand what\u2019s meant by higher-order/lower-order distributions, could you clarify?\n2.\t(p.3) In section 3.1, the term in the total evidence \\phi_j is not defined.\n3.\t(p.3) Could you comment on the implications of assuming that the estimated distribution can be factorized? \n4.\t(p.4) Could you comment on the difference that there is between NLL_ML and NLL_SOS from a modelling perspective?\n5.\t(p.4) The ELBO loss (6) is unclearly defined, and not connected to the direct context. I would suggest moving this to the section 3.3, where the prior p(\\theta) used in eq. (6) is actually defined.\n\nSpelling & typos:\n-\t(p.4) There are several typos in equation (8), where tau should be replaced with 1/\\sigma^2. \n-\t(p.8) In the last sentence, there is \u201cntwork\u201d instead of network.\n-\t(p.9) There is a typo in the name of J\u00f8sang in the references. \n-\t(p.10) In equation (13), due to the change of variable, there should be a \n-(1/\\tau^2) added;  \n-\t(p.10) In equation (14), the \\exp(-\\lambda*\\pi*(\u2026)) should be replaced with \\exp(-\\lambda*\\tau*(\u2026)). \n\n6: Weak Accept", "prompt": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review."}
